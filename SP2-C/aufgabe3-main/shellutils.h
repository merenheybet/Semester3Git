 * This function parses a command-line string that may contain <tt>'&'</tt> (for
 * background execution) as well as <tt>'<'</tt> and <tt>'>'</tt> for
 * <tt>stdin</tt> and <tt>stdout</tt> redirection, respectively.
 * shParseCmdLine() will generate the <tt>argv</tt> array for the given command
 * line and return an ShCommand structure containing the result. The members of
 * the <tt>argv</tt> array will point into the original string, whose contents
 * are modified for this purpose.
 *
 * The returned ShCommand structure lies in statically allocated memory and is
 * overwritten by subsequent calls to shParseCmdLine().
 *
 * @param cmdLine The command line to be parsed. This string is tokenized during
 *				  shParseCmdLine(). It must be no more than @ref MAX_CMDLINE_LEN
 *                characters long (including the terminating <tt>'\\0'</tt>),
 *                otherwise <tt>NULL</tt> is returned and <tt>errno</tt> is set
 *                to <tt>EINVAL</tt>.
 *
 * @return Pointer to the parsed ShCommand or <tt>NULL</tt> on error, with
 *         <tt>errno</tt> set appropriately. In case a custom error message is
 *         supplied, the function returns an ShCommand structure that has its
 *         <tt>parseError</tt> field set to a custom error message. If the
 *         <tt>parseError</tt> field is set to a value other than <tt>NULL</tt>,
 *         parsing the command line has failed and the remaining fields of the
 *         ShCommand structure must not be interpreted.
 *
 * @note This function does not interfere with any other functions, but it is @b
 *       not reentrant since it uses and reuses statically allocated memory.
