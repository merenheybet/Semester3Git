/**
 * @file
 * @brief List for bookkeeping of a shell's child processes.
 *
 * Since <a href=http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/>SUSv4</a>
 * offers no portable way to determine the current state of a process, the shell
 * itself has to keep a record of its child processes and their current states.
 *
 * Newly created processes can be added with plistAdd(), while terminated
 * processes can be removed with plistRemove().
 *
 * Information about a specific process can be obtained by calling plistGet().
 * To iterate over the entire list of child processes, plistIterate() can be
 * used.
 *
 * When a child process has changed its state (which is signaled to the shell
 * via @c SIGCHLD), the shell must update the process entry by calling
 * plistNotifyEvent(). The processes which have recently changed their state can
 * be obtained and processed with plistHandleEvents().
